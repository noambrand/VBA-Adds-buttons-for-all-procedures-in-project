# VBA Add buttons to all the procedures in all the modules in the active sheet  

Do you draw buttons and assign macros one by one?
The Excel VBA program adds buttons to all the procedures you have prepared in all the modules of the project.
All buttons will appear in one sheet at regular intervals from each other, so there is no need to create them one by one, including size, 
design, location control and saves the need to enter the editor (VBE) to run the commands from there.
